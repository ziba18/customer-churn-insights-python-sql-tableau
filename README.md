- 🗄️ SQL (SQLite & queries via Python or GUI)
- 📊 Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Functions)
- 📈 Tableau (Interactive dashboards & visuals)
- 📁 Jupyter Notebook
- 📌 GitHub (Version control & project hosting)

---

## 🧼 Data Source & Preparation

- Dataset: `customer_churn_data.csv`  
- Steps performed:
